<h1>JEST</h1>

JEST enables persistent data to be web-accessible using REST principle.
<p>
Most Java based application models a domain as a set of Enity classes.
The entity classes are similar to any other Java classes (that is why they
are called POJO or Plain Old Java Object). 
<p>
The entity instances are stored in a relational database. The entity definitions
define a relational schema and entity instances are stored as records
following that schema.
