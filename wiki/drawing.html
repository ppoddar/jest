<h1>Represenation of Object Model</h1>

An object model is a graph whose vertices are entities and edges are relations.

An entity is a collection of attributes.
A relation connects an entity-entity (ineritance), entity-attribute or
attribute=attribute.


<table>
<th></th>
<tr>
<td>Entity</td><td>div</td>
</tr>

</table>
An attribute is a viewd as a rectangle.
An attribute name and type. Two side-by-side divs.


An entity is viewed as an rectangle.  

a header.
attributes arranged vertically.


<h1>Placement</h1>

Each vertex is a rectangle with width and height.
Placement finds a position {x,y} for each entity so that
<ul>
<li>link length is low</li>
<li>no overlap</li>
<li>natural length is maintained</li>
</ul>

<h2>Natural Length</h2>
Consider each entity is connected to each other entity with two springs:
vertical and horizontal.

Each spring has a natural length. If the entity boxes are further apart than
natural length, then the spring pulls them closer. If they are colser than
normal length, then the spring  pushes them farther.

So what is the natural length between two entity?

Assume they are not linked.
Assume they are all equal dimension.
Let there be N entities.

let w and h be the average width and height of the boxes. 

dx = (W/sqrt N) - w;

dy = (H/sqrt N) -h

Now some boxes are linked and some are not

for each relation between A and B, natural distance (A,B) reduces by a factor f.
f depends on kind of link (ineritance or relation). 
link category may change natural length in different dimension differently.
